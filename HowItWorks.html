    <h2>Convenience</h2>
    <p>We are online food customers ourselves and found that sometimes, repeated online ordering and payments can be a
        hassle, and at times we prefer the convenience of something being done automatically.</p>

    <h2>Creates a habit</h2>
    <p>We know that when you’re watching what you eat, sometimes finding what to eat for each meal can be difficult. We
        hope that</p>

    <h2>Quality and affordability</h2>
    <p>We love freshly made bread and having a regular schedule and quantity helps us to ensure better quality products.
        By being able to plan ahead as well, we can order our raw ingredients in bulk and keep our products affordable.

    <div class="NeedToKnowMore">
        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>We are a home based F&B business in Kuala Lumpur, and our family started on the ketogenic lifestyle to
            maintain our health and well being. When we found it difficult to find good tasting keto meals on a regular
            basis, we started to make our own keto friendly food at home ourselves. We would share our food with friends
            and we would always get good feedback on the taste and how it didn’t taste like the other keto foods that
            they have tried before. Being able to share our love for making delicious and healthy meals was the
            inspiration that made us start Bread and Better.</p>
        <h2>How do we calculate our nutrition facts?</h2>
        <p>We use a nutrition recipe calculator to calculate each ingredient that goes into our recipe and we show the
            total carbs as well as the net carbs to ensure we provide you with as much information about our products as
            possible.</p>
        <h2>Can I cancel my plan after receiving my free loaf?</h2>
        <p>Yes, we believe that if you find that the product is not up to your expectations, you should be allowed to
            cancel your plan after your first free loaf, and there will be no further charges made to you.</p>
        <h2>How often can I receive my loaf?</h2>
        <p>You can choose to receive your loaf weekly, 1-4 times per month. You will also be able to choose the day you
            want to receive your loaf from the available delivery days.</p>
        <h2>When will I be charged?</h2>
        <p>The charges are monthly based on your selected plan, 1 week before your first scheduled delivery date for the
            month. This is so that we can prepare the raw ingredients and deliveries ahead of time. If you wish to make
            changes to your plan, you may do so before the next billing cycle.</p>
        <h2>Which locations do you deliver to?</h2>
        <p>For now we only deliver within the Klang Valley area. However we are looking to expand our services to other
            areas soon. If you want Better Bread in your area soon, let us know at
            <strong>Phoebe@breadandbetter.co</strong></p>
        <h2>Do you offer self collection?</h2>
        <p>We do not offer self collection as we are a home based business and it wouldn’t be practical for us to have
            customers coming to our home all the time.</p>
        <h2>Will you have other products besides Better Bread?</h2>
        <p>Yes! We have plans for other keto friendly products and we are always working on ensuring the taste and
            quality of our products before we offer them to you. If you have any requests for products, let us know at
            <strong>Phoebe@breadandbetter.co</strong></p>
        <h2>Why are our products named using girls names?</h2>
        <p>It’s better than 8” Keto Sandwich Bread isn’t it? We want our products to be approachable and friendly, so we
            named them after our favourite female TV characters if you didn’t realise that already :)</p>
